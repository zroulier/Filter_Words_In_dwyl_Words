# Filter_Words_In_dwyl_Words
This program uses the dictionary-api API to filter through the 479k word file from dwyl, to find words that are only found in dictionary-api's database. It then stores every word into a .csv file, automatically writing every API fetch in real time. The out .csv file has stats including each output word and its part of speech, and more.
